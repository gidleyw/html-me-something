				<p>Life is about balance. Balance work with play. Balance play with learning. Balance learning throughout your whole life. To achieve that perfect balance within oneself, one has to find the perfect balance. I know it seems obvious, but as I've grown older I've "lived and learned" (actually still learning!) what it takes to have a balanced life. 
				</p>

				<p>It's funny because I talk about balance as I'm an expert, but the truth is as I type this I know this assignment is late. What in my life is off kilter causing me to be late on my assignment? Something I will have to figure out. 
				</p>

				<p>The quest for balance is neverending and one must not stop their quest for balance. Or does one find balance and achieve supreme balance?
